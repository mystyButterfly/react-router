# React Router

This is small project for junior developers.

I used here different elements from React Router. Then I learned I needed the same one. Whar's why I decide to share.

I created this in React and Vite. You can see more about in internet about this. Just search "npm create vite".

To see the project you need to do next steps:

1. Download repository or copy directly.
